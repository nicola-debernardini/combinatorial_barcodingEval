"""
A script that, given the number of iterations, the number of cells, and the number of barcode in the sets, 
compute the probability of having two different cells with the same label.

Description
----------
The script iterates (based on the # of iter) the labelling of # cells with random combinations of barcodes. 
The total number of labels depend on the size and number of each barcode set (e.g. [16, 48, 48, 48]).
Then, it calculates within each iteration if there was at least an event in which 2 cells were labeled identically, 
and estimates the probability of double labelling based on the number of collesions/totalÂ iterations.

Methods
-------
show()
    Pretty prints the generated factory

create_label()
    Creates a randomly generated label which mimics the process of an object being randomly
    distributed to a labeling system for each zone in a sequential manner
